# glassntfy
An awful hack on the ntfy-android code to make it pipe notifications to the glass using ancient MyGlass bits. Uses local bluetooth (so no mirror api and works without internet!) and will conflict with any other apps using the bluetooth connection, so stop GlassEcho or MyGlass before using this.
